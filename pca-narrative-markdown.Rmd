## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Scope {.toc-ignore}

Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) includes information about the costs and volumes of prescription items that have been dispensed in England.

These statistics cover prescription items that were prescribed in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands that were subsequently dispensed in the community in England and submitted to the NHSBSA for reimbursement. When a prescription is 'dispensed in the community', it means that is was dispensed at a pharmacy, by and applicance contractor, dispensing doctor, or as a personally administered item. However, if a prescription item has been prescribed in England but dispensed elsewhere in the United Kingdom, it would not be included in these statistics.

This publication is a National Statistic release. National Statistics status means that PCA meets the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality, and public value and complies with all aspects of the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/).

The designation of this publication as a National Statistic was confirmed in May 2021 following an assessment by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). You can read more about this confirmation and the assessment of these statistics on the [OSR website](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-matthew-wilson-confirmation-of-national-statistics-designation-for-prescription-cost-analysis-england-statistics/).

Regarding the cost of reimbursement, in 2021/22, generic prescribing accounted for 61% of the total cost. This is the lowest rate in the reporting period. This is a decrease of 3 percentage points from the previous year. The proportion of costs attributed to generic prescribing has shown greater variation, with a range of 7 percentage points over the period.

## 4. About these statistics

### 4.1. Monthly PCA data {.toc-ignore}

The NHSBSA publishes a [monthly administrative management information dataset](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/dispensing-data/prescription-cost-analysis-pca-data) for PCA using the same methodology as these statistics however, it is not an Official Statistic.

There's a slight difference between the annual National Statistics and the monthly administrative data for PCA. The annual publication uses the geographical structure as of the 31st March for that year, while the monthly data uses the structure at the end of the month. If a dispensing contractor changes parent organisation during the year, this may affect the STP level total in the aggregated monthly data compared to the annual National Statistics, but it won't affect the national totals. However, such cases are rare.


### 4.2. Uses of these statistics {.toc-ignore}

These statistics serve several purposes, including:

* providing a national overview of community prescription costs and volumes in England for the calendar year

* analysing cost and volume trends across different levels of the BNF hierarchy

* allowing public scrutiny of national prescribing habits

* monitoring uptake of new to market proprietary presentations

* monitoring the proportion of prescriptions dispensed generically

### 4.3. Changes to this publication {.toc-ignore}

We have updated figures 8 and 9 relating to the items and costs per capita by STP to use maps to visualise the data.

Data in the summary tables is no longer provided to the lowest level of SNOMED code. Data at this level will be provided via our [Open Data Portal (ODP)](https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/).

For full details of the changes made please refer to the [Background Information and Methodology note](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2022-06/pca_2022_background_information_methodology_v001.odt) released alongside these statistics.

### 4.4. Timeliness of this publication {.toc-ignore}

This publication has historically been released in the month of April. To accommodate the inclusion of financial year information these statistics will now be released in June, after March data becomes available each year. Calendar year data is currently released at the same time as financial year information. We are going to get user’s views on publishing calendar year data earlier.

## 5. Rounding

The high-level figures in this statistical summary have been rounded as per the table below:

```{r rounding_table, out.width = "100%"}
rounding_table <- data.table(
  "From" = c("0", "1,001", "10,001", "100,001", "1,000,001", "10,000,001", "100,000,001"),
  "To" = c("1,000", "10,000", "100,000", "1,000,000", "10,000,000", "100,000,000", "100,000,000,000"),
  "Round to nearest" = c("1", "100", "1,000", "10,000", "100,000", "1,000,000", "10,000,000")
)

knitr::kable(rounding_table, align = "rrr")%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"))
```

All changes and totals are calculated prior to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated prior to rounding and then are rounded to the nearest whole number. As all figures within this statistical summary have been rounded, they may not add up.

The summary tables released with this publication allow users to investigate this data at lower levels of granularity. Figures in the supplementary tables have not been rounded.
